        <h2>History of the Pawn</h2>
        <div class="history-content">
            <div class="history-text">
                <p>The pawn has been a part of chess since its earliest known origins in India. The original game, **Chaturanga**, had pieces with similar movements to the ones in modern chess. Over time, chess spread to Persia, then to the Islamic world, and finally to Europe. The rules of the game evolved, but the pawn remained a core piece throughout. In medieval European chess, pawns were seen as expendable foot soldiers, yet they held strategic importance in large-scale battles.</p>
                <p>The unique ability of pawns to promote to other pieces (usually a queen) makes them central to the dynamics of modern chess. Reaching the opposite side of the board has become a key strategy for many chess players, especially in endgames.</p>

        <h2>How the Pawn Moves</h2>
        <div class="pawn-move-content">
            <div class="pawn-move-description">
                <h3>The Basic Movement</h3>
                <p>The pawn moves forward one square at a time. It can only move forward and never backward. However, on its first move, a pawn has the option to move two squares forward. If there are no pieces in its way, the pawn continues to move straight ahead.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="pawn-move-description">
                <h3>The Capture Movement</h3>
                <p>While the pawn moves forward, it captures diagonally. This means that a pawn can take an opponent's piece that is positioned one square diagonally in front of it. Pawns cannot capture pieces that are directly in front of them.</p>

            <div class="pawn-move-description">
                <h3>Pawn Promotion</h3>
                <p>When a pawn reaches the opposite side of the board, it is eligible for promotion. The player can choose to promote the pawn to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight, depending on the player's strategy. In most cases, the pawn is promoted to a queen, as it is the most powerful piece in the game.</p>
